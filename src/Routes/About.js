                    I’m Kimi Lewis, an independent art director and designer in Los Angeles. With a background in typography and illustration, my work includes brand identity, type design, art direction, editorial, packaging, and digital marketing. I work with a diverse range of forward-thinking clients to craft elegant and memorable visual stories driven by bespoke typographic identities.

                    I approach my work as a creative partner, collaborating with my clients to outline a strategy and develop shared points of reference to best communicate and package their story. As a studio of one, I’m comfortable working solo or assembling a team to best serve a project’s needs. 
                </p>

                    Inspired by art and design histories that range from the classical to the modern, I celebrate typographic-driven design to create bold, compelling experiences for the beauty, fashion, lifestyle industries and beyond.
